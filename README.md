# Fake_News_Detection

All data we use could be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data.

Before running the code, make sure python3 is used. The required libraries are numpy, panda matplotlib, gensim sklearn and nltk. run pip install to install the missing packages

To preprocess data, run driver to generate xte.npy,yte.npy,xtr.npy,ytr.npy and get the results for naive bayes and SVM for our baseline.
To view data analysis, run jupyter notebook to execute data_analysis.ipynb
Use jupyter notebook to execute DenseNet.ipynb to view results for Neural network, LSTM.ipynb to view results for LSTM and BLSTM.ipynb to view results for BiLSTM
